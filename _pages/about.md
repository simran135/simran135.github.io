I am an incoming PhD student in the [CS department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I am broadly interested in the foundations and applications of machine learning.

I recently completed my BS in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/) at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/) in the [ACMI Lab](https://acmilab.org/people/simran-kaur/).

In my spare time, I enjoy running, painting, and baking biscotti!
